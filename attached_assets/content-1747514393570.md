### NAVIGATE EASILY

Getting around in some apps can be maddening, but with NeuBible’s spine navigation, it’s easy to remember where you are. Plus, you’re always within a thumb’s reach of where you need to be, (and it’s even easy to use with the larger screens of the iPhone 6/7, iPhone 6/7 Plus, & the iPad Pro).

### READ CLEARLY

With fonts hand-picked and licensed from some of world’s best type foundries, like Hoefler & Co, LatinoType, Commercial Type & DSType — as well as hand-tuned margins, line spacing and font sizes — NeuBible offers one of the most beautiful and considered reading experiences you’ll find on iOS.

### FIND IT FASTER

From its insanely quick loading speed, to its inventive use of navigation, everything about NeuBible has been optimized and engineered to get you to books and verses, and get reading as quickly as possible.

## SEARCH BETTER

Using search should be as simple and comprehensive as possible. With NeuBible’s world-class _Quick Search_, there’s never been an easier way to find what you’re looking for.

Like “SPOTLIGHT” for the Bible, whether it’s verses, books, keywords, or even people — live search results will appear in real-time as you type.

#PROTIP: DOUBLE-TAP TO SEARCH. Instead of swiping back to books for search, simply double-tap the screen. It’s fun, easy to use, and makes for lightning-fast navigation when you’re sitting in church and need to get to a verse.

## REMEMBER BETTER

Stumbling onto highlights in your old Bible was great, but they didn’t really tell you much beyond the fact that it was a meaningful verse that meant something to you at one point. Well, with Timeline, we hope to shoulder a little bit of that load, and hopefully give you some context to help you remember why highlighted that verse in the first place.

SMART HIGHLIGHTS. Smart Highlights group highlights made within certain periods of time, like during a sermon or Bible study, and group them together to help denote their relationship.

SEAMLESS ICLOUD SYNC. NeuBible seamlessly, and effortlessly, backs-up both the state of your timeline and highlights in the background. You’ll never have to do any of the work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**WHY DOES DESIGN MATTER? SHOULDN’T THE BIBLE BE ENOUGH ON ITS OWN?** Design, when properly realized, brings credibility and consistency, and helps people understand the world around them in better and more enjoyable ways.

**WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY “CONSIDERED DESIGN”?** While design can be a subjective practice, we believe that there are correct places to start and specific decisions to make that lead to well-designed, thoughtful results that truly benefit the user. We’ve made all of our design and product decisions in a very purposeful manner, and based them in historical and modern best-practices. We’re also relying on our experience as designers who have been in the field for quite some time. Through our work in print, traditional graphic, and web & mobile product design, we aim to bring a well-rounded, holistic point-of-view to the app’s creation.

**WHY DOESN’T NEUBIBLE OFFER MORE TRANSLATIONS?** We believe NeuBible to be the absolute best way to read the Bible on your phone, and having your preferred translation available is as important to that experience as any feature or design detail will ever be. That said, what most people may not know is that licensing can be an involved and, well, expensive process. Most translations have different publishers with different royalty and licensing requirements in place. As NeuBible grows, we will hope to provide updates to bring new translations into the app.

**WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF NEUBIBLE?**

The NeuBible app was purchased by Dwell App, LLC in 2021. Dwell has long admired NeuBible's emphasis on aesthetic excellence and shares a similar set of values to the Bible-reading app. As it stands, NeuBible is both a delightful and soulful tool for reading the Scriptures. In the coming months, Dwell will be considering the ways in which both apps can best live together in the same space.
