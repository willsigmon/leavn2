Here’s a detailed Replit-ready instruction block you can paste into your agent to fully implement a RAG-based tagging system for Leavn, using the cached WEB & KJV Bibles as source material.

This plan includes caching, keyword analysis, spiritual metadata tagging, and creating a serendipitous retrieval engine.

⸻


🧠 TASK: Build a RAG-powered tagging + retrieval system using the full Bible (WEB + KJV)

---

A. 📥 CACHE FULL BIBLE TEXT (WEB + KJV)

1. Download both versions from a public domain source (like https://ebible.org or https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org).
2. Store each version as a JSON file:
   Structure:
   {
     "Genesis 1:1": {
       "web": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.",
       "kjv": "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
     },
     ...
   }

3. Save as `bible_cache.json`
   - Load into memory on app start or stream-load by book for performance

---

B. 🧩 ANALYZE EACH VERSE FOR KEYWORDS

1. Use keyword extraction (via OpenAI embedding, `keybert`, or regex + TF-IDF) to find:
   - Named people
   - Places
   - Time markers (e.g., “on the third day”, “in the year of…”)
   - Spiritual themes (manual seed list + LLM enrichment)

2. Optional: Augment with GPT-powered enrichment:
   For each verse, prompt:
   > “What spiritual themes, people, places, timeframes, and symbols are referenced or implied in this verse?”

3. Save this metadata per verse:
   ```json
   {
     "Genesis 1:1": {
       "themes": ["Creation", "Divine Power"],
       "figures": ["God"],
       "places": ["Heaven", "Earth"],
       "timeframe": ["Beginning of Time"],
       "symbols": ["Light", "Darkness"]
     }
   }

C. 🧠 BUILD RAG TAGGING SYSTEM
	1.	Index all extracted tags in a vector store (e.g., pinecone, weaviate, or in-memory embeddings).
	2.	Use a reverse index:

{
  "Creation": ["Genesis 1:1", "Genesis 1:3", "Psalm 104:30"],
  "Jesus": ["John 3:16", "Matthew 1:1", "Isaiah 53:5"]
}


	3.	On user interaction:
	•	Get verse embedding or query context
	•	Retrieve top matching tags
	•	Pull linked verses, themes, commentary, etc.
	4.	Cache “Featured Tags” per verse on load using:

getTopTags(verseId) => pickRandom(matchingTags, 2–3)



⸻

D. 🎯 FINAL TAG TYPES (MAP TO UI + AI CONTEXT)

Define each tag schema:

Tag Type	Key	Examples
🌍 Location	places	Egypt, Sea of Galilee, Mount Sinai
🧍 Figure	figures	Moses, Jesus, Mary, Nicodemus
📜 Theme	themes	Covenant, Rebirth, Forgiveness
⏳ Time	timeframe	“In the beginning,” “Passover,” “Exile”
🔣 Symbol	symbols	Water, Fire, Bread, Light
🧠 Lens	lens_notes	Interpretive notes per tradition
🔗 CrossRef	cross_refs	Similar or echoing passages
❤️ Emotion	emotions	Joy, Trust, Betrayal, Fear

Each tag links to: verses, commentary, and other tag relationships.

⸻

Let me know when you’re ready for:
	•	A starter tag JSON structure
	•	GPT tagging prompts for enrichment
	•	Live retrieval UI examples (Tag → Verse → Context)

This system makes the app feel **alive and interconnected**, surfacing hidden meaning without being heavy-handed.

Want to run tagging offline first or fully LLM-based? I can help with either path.
