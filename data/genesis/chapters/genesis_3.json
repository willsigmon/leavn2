  "narrative": "The harmonious relationship between humanity and God is fractured when the cunning serpent questions God's command not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. With subtle deception, he convinces Eve that the forbidden fruit will make her like God, knowing good and evil. After eating and sharing with Adam, their eyes are opened to their nakedness, and they hide from God in shame. When confronted, Adam blames Eve, and Eve blames the serpent. God pronounces judgment on all three: the serpent is cursed to crawl on its belly, enmity is placed between the serpent and woman, Eve will experience pain in childbirth, and Adam must toil against thorns and thistles. Yet amidst judgment, God provides clothing from animal skins—a hint of grace—before banishing them from Eden.",
