  "narrative": "In majestic, rhythmic language, Genesis 1 portrays God as the sovereign creator who brings order from chaos through his spoken word. With each divine declaration, new aspects of creation emerge in a purposeful sequence, culminating in humanity who bears God's image and is given responsibility to care for creation. The repeated refrain 'and it was good' affirms the inherent value of the created world, while God's rest on the seventh day establishes a pattern for human living.",
