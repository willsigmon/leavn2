The mysterious reference to 'sons of God' and Nephilim points to extraordinary transgressions of created boundaries. Against this backdrop of corruption and violence, Noah stands as a righteous exception who finds favor with God. The detailed instructions for building the ark demonstrate both divine provision and Noah's meticulous obedience in preparing for an unprecedented deluge.

After more than a year confined in the ark, Noah receives God's command to disembark and begin afresh in a cleansed world. His first act upon setting foot on dry ground is to build an altar and offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and devotion.

The rainbow covenant represents God's unilateral promise never again to destroy all life by flood, regardless of human behavior.

His journey through Canaan is marked by altar-building as he worships the God who appeared to him. However, when famine drives him to Egypt, Abram's faith falters as he resorts to deception about Sarai's identity to protect himself.
